	help
	  This kernel config can be used to enable PTPOD.
	  When enable this option, voltage will be
	  changed which will depended on chip.
	  If unsure, say N.

config MTK_STATIC_POWER
	bool "MTK STATIC POWER"
	help
	  This kernel config can be used to enable static power.
	  This information can provide power data to someone who
	  need it
	  If unsure, say N.

config MTK_UNIFY_POWER
	bool "MTK UNIFY POWER"
	help
	  This kernel config can be used to enable unified power table.
	  This table can provide power data and capacity to someone who
	  need it.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config CPU_FORCE_TO_BIN2
	bool "Read extra efuse for BIN2 IC"
	help
	  This kernel config can be used to force cpu to segment BIN2.
	  When enable this option, eem driver will read extra efuse to
