config HAVE_MTK_MC
	bool "MediaTek Memory Controller support"
	depends on ARCH_MEDIATEK
	help
	  This driver supports the Memory Controller (MC) hardware found on
	  MediaTek(R) SoCs. The config enables MTK_DRAMC and MTK_EMI
	  for the control of DRAMC and EMI drivers respectively. This config
	  will be enabled by default for MTK SoC.

config MTK_DRAMC
	tristate "MediaTek DRAMC driver"
	depends on HAVE_MTK_MC
	help
	  This selects the MediaTek(R) DRAMC driver.
	  Provide the API for DRAMC low power scenario, and the interface
	  for reporting DRAM information, e.g. DRAM mode register (MR) for
	  DRAM vendor ID, temperature, and density.

config MTK_EMI
	tristate "MediaTek EMI driver"
	depends on HAVE_MTK_MC
	help
	  This selects the MediaTek(R) EMI driver.
	  Provide the API for MPU registration, EMI MPU violation handling,
	  the API for EMI information, the BWL golden setting,
	  and the sysfs for EMI ISU control.
